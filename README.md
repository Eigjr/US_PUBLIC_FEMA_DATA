### FEMA DISASTER PIPELINE

## INTRODUCTION
FEMA stands for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that coordinates disaster response and recovery efforts in the United States.FEMA's mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This pipeline performs Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations on FEMA data to support disaster analysis across the United States.
It ingests data from the FEMA API, applies transformations using Python (Pandas) to structure and clean the dataset, and loads it into a data warehouse. The processed data is then available for visualization and analysis, enabling analysts to better understand the nature of disasters and their impacts nationwide.
